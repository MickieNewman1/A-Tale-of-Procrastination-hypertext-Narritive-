		<q>Well, I guess this was always where this would go. I don’t know why I was kidding myself. This always happens. You know when this project was announced I was really excited. I love writing stories and generally I’m a good student. Like before college I was a strait A’s uptight everything in on time type of person. Now I can’t even leave the house without being heavily medicated. What’s the point? I can’t even see a future where I’m legitimately happy even if I get all my fancy degrees, I’ve just broken myself for a piece of paper and a boring job that will take up most of my days until I eventually die. I hope I die young. </q>

		<q>I’m sorry I got mad at you. This was inevitable whether it was now or in sixty years. I guess I’m just the kind of person to lay down and give up. </q>

		<q>I guess I have to live with that.</q>
