		<q>A drive sounds good. I need to get out of this house. </q>
	</p>
	<p>
		<q>I think I should just keep going, I mean by getting in the car I already knew I wasn’t going to get anything done. I wonder how long it will be until I run out of gas.</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		<q>Thank you for being with me for making decisions for me. I never know what I want. I’m ashamed of not knowing what I want. I wish you could be here forever but I know you will be gone once the project is done. And I’m just stuck here driving.</q>

		<q>I just want someone to tell me what to wear in the morning… I mean I want someone to tell me what to wear every morning. I want someone to tell me what to eat what to like what to hate what to rage about. What to listen to what bands to like. What to buy tickets for. What to joke about what not to joke about.I want someone to tell me what to believe in. Who to vote for and who to love and how to tell them.</q>

	<p>
		<q>I just want someone to tell me how to live my life because so far I think I’ve been getting it all wrong.</q>
