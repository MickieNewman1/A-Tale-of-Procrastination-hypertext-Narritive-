		<q>With the power of Adderall anything is possible</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		<q>Ok its done, it’s a little rough around the edges but it will do. I got a C which is ok but honestly, I’ll take just about anything now. It’s just good enough that I don’t have to change. I don’t even know what changing would mean. Therapy? Medication? Sobriety? Finding something I’m passionate about? Cleaning my apartment? Being satisfied with myself?</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		<q>Thanks for your help. I can’t stress enough how much you helped. This probably wouldn’t have gotten done without you.</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		<q>I’m not good at decisions I’m glad you made them for me.</q>
